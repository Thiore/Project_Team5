    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740353
    m_Localized: The route to the cargo bay has been mapped, but with the ship's

    m_Localized: What? Engine room? I can't go there right now. I have to find other
      people first!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740357
    m_Localized: If the current error condition is left unattended, it could potentially
      result in catastrophic damage to the entire ship. I recommend that you move
      to the engine room to protect your systems.

      and engine are fixed?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740369

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740371
    m_Localized: As of now, couldn't know about the reason of leaving the ship. But

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740379
    m_Localized: Forklift can operate normally if you have key. If you make a temporary
      structure with forklift, you can go upstairs enough.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740380
    m_Localized: I've never driven forklift, so can you drive it and make a temporary
      structure?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740381
    m_Localized: The forklift is operated in an analog manner, so direct driving
      through this system is difficult. Please refer to the driving manual in the
      vehicle.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740382
    m_Localized: Is it right to let unlicensed driver drive the forklift? It seems
      like it's somewhat useful, but also not really...

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740383
    m_Localized: What... What the hell was happening? What are these bloodstains?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740384

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702352740386
    m_Localized: Looking at the system logs, it seems more likely that there was
      internal strife among the crew rather than an external intrusion.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702356934656
    m_Localized: This is ridiculous. They didn't just run away, they fought and killed
      each other? Why did you leave me on this ship in this situation?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702356934657
    m_Localized: As I mentioned in the cargo bay, if you analyze the data in the
      wheelhouse, you will be able to get more detailed information.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702356934659

      system.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702356934663
    m_Localized: Among the files currently remaining on the console, there are automatically
      recorded files. Since automatic recording always leaves only the most recent,
      the situation at the time of abandonment may remain.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      the bosun and ran away to save themselves\u2026 and left me here!"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702356934669
    m_Localized: Based on the recording and the bloodstains, it appears that the

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 18095702356934671
    m_Localized: The communication system and distress signals have a slightly different
      system. To send a signal, the captain's security key must be connected to the
      console.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      properly after you send a distress signal, you will end up having been framed.

    m_Localized: According to the document, the captain planned to place all the
      blame on you. If you use this, it can be strong evidence for the accusation.

    m_Localized: It's too early to be thankful. Even if you send a distress signal,
      it's not a complete escape. You'll have to fight a lonely battle with the evidence
      you've collected.

    m_Localized: That's right. This ship can no longer continue to drift. The only
      way to resolve the situation is to send a distress signal.

    m_Localized: Yes, if I send a distress signal, the government forces will investigate
      this ship. I and everything on board will be exposed.

    m_Localized: Based on the evidence collected, there is enough evidence to prove
      your innocence. There is a list of contraband items found in the captain's
      cabin, a plan of operation, and even contraband items in the cargo bay. All
      of this will ensure your innocence.

    m_Localized: The result can only be known by inserting the security key and sending
      a distress signal. If you don't send it now, you, this ship, and its dangerous
      cargo will be buried forever at sea.

    m_Localized: You know exactly what's on this ship, right? If we get caught, we'll
      be executed at the very least! There's a patrol ship nearby. If we delay any
      longer, we'll be caught. Move quickly!
